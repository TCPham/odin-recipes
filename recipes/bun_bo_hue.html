    <h1>Bun Bo Hue</h1>
    <img src="../images/bun_bo_hue.jpg" alt="Bun Bo Hue" height="310" width="310">
    <p>Bun Bo Hue is a hidden Vietnamese gem that has yet to “make it” 
        in mainstream American cuisine. It's a rich and spicy 
        soup with deep layers of flavor. This Central Vietnamese 
        soup is paired with tender slices of beef and pork, then 
        topped with lots of fresh herbs.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <!--ordered list-->
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the bones and meat: To a large stockpot, 
            add knuckles, boneless shanks and tendon. Add water to 
            cover and bring the pot to a boil. When the pot reaches a 
            rolling boil and impurities float to the top (about 5-7 
            minutes after boiling), turn off the heat. Place a 
            colander in the sink and drain the contents of the pot 
            into the colander. Thoroughly rinse bones/meat under 
            cold running water and drain dry. Wrap up boneless pork 
            shank into a tight bundle with twine for easier slicing 
            later.</li>

        <li>Wash the used pot thoroughly and return it to the 
            stove. Transfer parboiled bones/meat to the pot and 
            fill with 5 quarts of water. Smash the lemongrass stalks 
            and tie them with twine. Peel the shallots/onions and 
            slice the ginger into thick coins. All all to the 
            stockpot. Bring the pot to a boil then lower heat to 
            cook on a low simmer, covered, for 2 hours. Occasionally 
            skim the surface of the stock to keep it clear.</li>

        <li>After one hour of cooking, pork knuckles should be done 
            first. Check the knuckles for doneness by piercing it 
            with a chopstick. When chopstick pierces through easily 
            without resistance, knuckles are done. Remove and set 
            aside. After 1 1/2 hours, beef and pork shanks should be 
            done too. Check for doneness by piercing them with a 
            chopstick. If there is no resistance and water runs 
            clear, shanks are done. Remove and set aside with the 
            knuckles. Beef tendons will cook the longest (about 
            2 hours). Once done, transfer tendon, shanks, and 
            knuckles to the refrigerator to cool. For quicker 
            cooling, place them in an iced bath. Chilling will firm 
            up the meat and make it easier for slicing. Once chilled, 
            cut knuckles into bite-size pieces if they are too big, 
            and thinly sliced the shanks and tendon. Set everything 
            aside as meaty toppings.</li>

        <li>Remove all remaining solids (onions/shallots, ginger, 
            lemongrass, and pineapple) from the stockpot. Season 
            stock with chicken stock powder, fish sauce, sea salt, 
            rock sugar, and fermented shrimp paste. Add a little at 
            a time to your liking. For the fermented shrimp paste, 
            it's best to whisk it together with a bit of stock water 
            to prevent clumps then pour it into the stockpot.</li>

        <li>Sate sauce: In a small saucepan, heat up vegetable 
            oil on medium-low heat. Add shallots and lemongrass. 
            Pan fry for 10 seconds or until fragrant. Add garlic, 
            your desired amount of chili peppers, and Bun Bo Hue 
            seasoning packet next. Pan fry for 5 seconds then turn 
            off the heat to prevent burning. If you can't find 
            Bun Bo Hue seasoning powder, substitute with paprika or 
            similar red pepper powder. Season with fish sauce and 
            sugar. Add sate sauce to the stock. For those with 
            children or anyone who can't handle spicy food, divide 
            the stock before adding sate sauce, or simply add sate 
            sauce to individual bowls instead.</li>

        <li>Cook the noodles for 20 minutes or until soft 
            (disregard package instructions as I typically find 
            that it's never long enough). Place a colander in the 
            sink and drain noodles into the colander. Rinse with 
            cold water to prevent sticking.</li>

        <li>To assemble, place a handful of noodles into a bowl. Add 
            desired amount of sliced boneless shanks, pork 
            knuckles/hocks, sliced Vietnamese ham (Cha Lua/Gio Lua) 
            and pork blood cubes (if using). Ladle in hot broth. 
            Garnish with sliced green onions and cilantro. 
            Serve with a platter of fresh vegetables and lime/lemon 
            wedges. You can also serve with a small bowl of shrimp 
            paste and sate sauce on the side for further individual 
            customizations.</li>
