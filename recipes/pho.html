    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <!--ordered list-->
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the 
            preheated oven until browned, about one hour.</li>

        <li>Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the 
            preheated oven until blackened and soft, 
            about 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, 
            and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with 
            four quarts of water. Bring to a boil and 
            reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for six to 10 hours. 
            Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>

        <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room 
            temperature water and allow to soak for one hour. 
            Bring a large pot of water to a boil and after the 
            noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water 
            for one minute. Bring stock to a simmer.</li>

        <li>Divide noodles among four serving bowls; top with 
            sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over 
            the top. Stir and let sit until the beef is partially 
            cooked and no longer pink, one to two minutes. Serve with 
            bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, 
            and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
